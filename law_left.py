Implements Law for Left turning Scenario.

Needs pre-identified list of other actors which have priority
(i.e. the vehicles that are oncoming)

STvO
Section 8 - paragraph 2
(2) A person who has to give way must clearly and in good time show,
by means of appropriate driving behaviour, especially by reducing their
speed, that they are going to wait. They may only proceed if they can
see that they will neither endanger nor substantially impede a road
user who has the right of way. If they are unable to see this because
the intersection or junction has limited visibility, they may carefully
advance onto the intersection or junction until they have a clear view.
Nor must a road user who is obliged to give way substantially impede a
road user who has the right of way when the latter turns into the other
road.
